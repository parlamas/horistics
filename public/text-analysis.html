Grammar and Syntax:

    προσευξόμενος τε τῇ θεᾷ:
        "Praying to the goddess" or "about to pray to the goddess."
        προσευξόμενος is a nominative participle that modifies the subject, referring to the person performing the action. The phrase expresses an action happening concurrently with what follows.

    καὶ ἅμα τὴν ἑορτὴν βουλόμενος θεάσασθαι:
        "And at the same time wanting to behold the festival."
        βουλόμενος is a participle (present middle) that, like προσευξόμενος, refers to the subject and shows intention.

    τίνα τρόπον ποιήσουσιν:
        "How they will make it" or "in what manner they will perform it."
        τίνα τρόπον is an interrogative phrase that functions as an indirect question, modifying θεάσασθαι, explaining what the subject is interested in observing.
        ποιήσουσιν is the verb in the future active indicative (3rd person plural), indicating the action to be performed by "they."

Translation:

"Praying to the goddess and, at the same time, wishing to see how they will perform the festival."
Key Points:

    The sentence is structured around two participles, προσευξόμενος and βουλόμενος, both modifying the subject (which we can infer from the context).
    ἅμα ("at the same time") links the two participles, suggesting simultaneous actions.
    The use of τίνα τρόπον introduces an indirect question, modifying θεάσασθαι, specifying the subject's curiosity about how something will be done.
